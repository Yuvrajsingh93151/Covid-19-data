ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global Covid-19 data using Python (Pandas) for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation, followed by Tableau for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
The goal is to uncover insights into the spread of the virus, recovery trends, mortality rates, and regional impacts.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) â€“ for data cleaning, wrangling, and preliminary analysis.
Tableau â€“ for building dashboards and interactive visualizations
Dataset â€“ Covid-19 dataset (e.g., WHO, Kaggle, or John Hopkins University).

ðŸ”‘ Key Steps
Data Collection â€“ Imported Covid-19 dataset.
Data Cleaning (Pandas)
Handling missing values
Renaming columns
Creating new calculated fields (e.g., Active Cases = Confirmed - (Recovered + Deaths))
Aggregating data by Country/Date
Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ Identified patterns, trends, and anomalies.
Data Visualization (Tableau)
Time-series analysis (Confirmed, Recovered, Deaths)
Country-wise comparison (Top 10 affected countries)
Recovery & Mortality rates
Interactive filters (Date, Country, Continent)

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Insights
Trend of Covid-19 cases over time.
Countries with highest confirmed cases & deaths.
Comparison of recovery vs. death rates.
Regional spread analysis with interactive maps.

ðŸš€ Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience in data cleaning & transformation using Pandas.

Built a professional Tableau dashboard to present Covid-19 insights.

Improved understanding of real-world data analysis workflow.
